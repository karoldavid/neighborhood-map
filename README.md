# NEIGHBORHOOD-MAP

### Here is a link to the live version:

#### Description:

The neighborhood map is a single-page application featuring a map and additional functionality, including: map markers to
identify popular locations or places, a search function to discover these locations, and a listview to support simple
browsing. Furthermore third-party APIs provide additional information about each of these locations.

#### Purpose:

Design patterns assist in developing manageable codebases. Frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application
and provide a number of utilities. Third-party APIs provide valuable data sets that can improve the application's quality, 
for ex.: knockout.js helps to simplify dynamic JavaScript UIs using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.

#### The neighborhood map app is part of the Udacity Front-End Webdeveloper Nanodegree:
