#### Purpose

Design patterns assist in developing manageable codebases. Frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application
and provide a number of utilities. Third-party APIs provide valuable data sets that can improve the application's quality, 
for ex.: knockout.js helps to simplify dynamic JavaScript UIs using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.
